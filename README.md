# Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks of projects that I have been working on and with while studying data analysis and ML with Python. The notebooks contain basic steps on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, prediction model creation, and model refinement.
Detailed information is provided in each notebook. The steps of data analysis in these notebooks follow the basic data science circle.


## Data Preparation

The first notebook is dedicated to data preparation. It includes the following steps:

* Data acquisition
* Data cleaning: handling missing values, correcting data format, standardizing, and normalizing data
* Introducing an indicator (dummy) variable
* Binning
* Descriptive statistical analysis
* Correlation and causation

## Prediction Modelling

The second notebook deals with model development. It includes the following steps and objectives:

* Linear regression
* Multiple regression
* Model evaluation
* Polynomial regression
* In-sample evaluation
* Prediction and decision-making

## The third notebook is dedicated to feature engineering and consists of the following steps: 

* Splitting the data into training and testing sets
* Cross-validation
* Overfitting and underfitting
* Ridge regression
* Grid search

All the notebooks are based on the learning material of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course material.
The data sets are downloaded from the IBM server.
